					h3 Why are we using Slack?
					p The Facebook group is frustrating many people. It is not conducive to conversations between a large group of people. Slack allows us to separate discussions in channels and sub groups to everyone can meep track of what matters to them.
					h3 How do I use the channels?
					p Channels are like sub groups in the Slack. You can join any channel and leave it, set notifications for it or ignore a channel altogether.

					h3 Does this replace our hub's whatsapp/facebook/etc?
					p No, it does not. You are welcome to use Slack of course, but we are not trying to disturb hub-specific communication dynamics.
					h3 How do I contact specific people?
					p You can send direct messages to any member. If you want to involve them in a discussion you can tag them with their user handle. Have a look at the Slack explanation video:
